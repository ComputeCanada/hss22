**Description**: As a way to illustrate Research Data Management (RDM) in practice, this session will feature a panel consisting of both researchers and those working in research support, discussing their experiences with data management, with a focus on unforeseen events that can lead to a disruption, near disruption, or horror story in a research project. The session will be led by Nick Rochlin, Research Data Management Specialist in UBC’s Advanced Research Computing team/department, but we encourage you to bring questions that are specific to your work. If you have questions you’d like to submit before the sessions, please do here; but if not, we will happily take questions live. (Also, if you’d just like to listen, that’s totally fine too!).
