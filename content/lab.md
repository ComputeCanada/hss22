**Duration**: 4 Hours 

**Description**: Do you have a research project you are struggling with and need some programming help? Do you want to try out programming but aren't sure where to start or what you would use it for? In this lab you can recieve 1v1 help with programming projects you bring, or work through some pre-made code projects with an instructor. Try out topic modeling, scraping the web, grabbing data from Twitter, or play an interactive game designed to teach you command line!
